## Your goals for this lab

### Broadly
The aim for this lab is to practice adapting to and understanding code in a new-to-you (or not) language and its own libraries/packages -- JavaScript, in this case.

The programming skills you have built up till now are useful for *Python programming*, but, more than that, they extend to fundamentals of many kinds of programming.

This experience is *not in any way* about becoming an expert JavaScript programmer. Instead, it is about using what you *do* have experience with -- and your skills in *learning new things* that relate to programming -- in order to make educated judgments about some brand new-to-you code, even if you haven't learned in detail about it yet. That's part of what being in technology -- or even technology-adjacent -- will often mean.

### Specifically

Below are a bunch of questions and indications of things to do. For each indication of something to do with code, there is also an accompanying question to answer or brief explanation to give. 

**To complete and submit this assignment, you should:**

* Fork (and clone) this repository
* Add our instructional team as a collaborator to your fork (see instructions for adding collaborators on Canvas)
* Edit this `README.md` file with answers to the questions, briefly, using Markdown formatting so that the questions appear in bulletpoints and the answers appear clearly below each respective question, *not* as bulletpoints.
* Make the changes that are indicated below to each of the `.html` files provided.
* Commit (as you go) and push your changes to all three files to your GitHub forked repository.
* Submit a link to your repository on Canvas. (This HW doesn't have an autograder -- it will be graded by hand/by humans this time.)

### Important notes
* You are *more than* welcome to work together on this, but **you must <u>each</u> submit a lab to be graded on it**, so if you do work together, you should do the following:
	* Make sure each one of you understands all the work -- YOU are responsible for using and knowing this information
	* Write each person's name & uniqname who worked on the assignment together on your submitted `README.md` file (you'll see a space for this below)

* **For grading:** we are grading on...
	* Following the instructions
	* Approximate correctness of the code edits
	* Careful & clear answers to the questions
	* Correct answers to the questions
	* Slightly more than half the 1000 points will come from answering the questions. The rest will come from your edits to the code.

### Names of people you have worked with on this assignment
* List 
* Everyone's
* Names and uniqnames who have worked on this assignment with you, **including your own name**
* Like this: 
* Jackie Cohen (jczetta)
* Yea-Ree Chang (cyearee)
* etc.

## Questions & code instructions

### The first questions address the `jsPracticeLab.html` file.

* What does a code comment look like in JavaScript? What character/s do you have to put before a comment?

* Explain what needs to happen to get a JavaScript program to "run", given the JavaScript you've seen in this assignment.

* What functions in JavaScript seem to be similar in function to the `print` function in Python? (There are two.) Why might you use one and not the other? Explain briefly.

* What code would have to comment out to get rid of the pop-up box when you load the page? (Related to the last question.) Do that in the code file, and then, add code so that a text box will appear that contains the current date and time! *HINT:* Look through the rest of the code first...

* How can you put your own name at the top where it currently says "A name"? Explain very briefly how to do so, and replace `A name` in the web page with your own name.

* What does the word `document` represent in this code? Explain briefly.

* What is happening in line 12 ( 
		`document.querySelector('#items').innerHTML = document.getElementsByTagName('li').length`
)? Explain, briefly (<= 2 sentences).

* What color would the background of this page be <u>if there were no JavaScript in this page</u>?

* Why are there a couple of gray boxes on the screen with a different colored border? How could you edit this code to make them a different color? Explain briefly. Then edit the code to make those boxes some shade of blue, of your choosing.

* Edit the code so that, if you highlight `McGill University` and copy it, you see the text `O Canada` near the bottom of the page. Briefly explain why you made the edits that you did -- how did you know/figure out what to do?

* TODO something about 

### The next few questions address the `jquerylib_submit_example.html` file.

* Check out the file `jquerylib_submit_example.html`. This is a 

* Why is the error red

* What is this line `var regex = /^[a-zA-Z]+$/;` helping with?

* What's different about the syntax of the if statements?

* Maybe something about relying on jQuery
